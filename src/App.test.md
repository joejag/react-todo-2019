# React Testing Library exercises

Inside `App.test.js` you will find one completed test and seven tests for you to fill in.

First of all, open up the [React Testing Library cheatsheet](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library/raw/master/other/cheat-sheet.pdf) which gives you a hint on how to test things.

If you get stuck, you can ping Joe or have a look at the [completed version of the exercises](https://github.com/joejag/react-todo-2019/blob/final/src/App.test.js).

## Exercise instructions

Progress one by one through the exercises.

You can do these exercises without ever using the approach of adding a TestId to an element. You are encouraged to change the existing code to improve the ability to test it. Sometimes this is best done by making things more accessible.

When testing, use this preference order when deciding how to test something:

- ByLabelText
- ByPlaceholderText
- ByText
- ByDisplayValue
- ByAltText
- ByTitle
- ByRole
- ByTestId (do not use this in this workshop!)

Good luck!

Note: The "works with async calls" test will make you rewrite two previous tests, it doesn't make you write a new test.
