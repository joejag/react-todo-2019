# React Testing Library workshop

👋 hi there! My name is [Joe Wright](https://code.joejag.com/)!

This repo contains a workshop to teach you about React Testing Library.

## System Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2 or greater
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) v10 or greater
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

## Setup

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/joejag/react-todo-2019.git
cd react-todo-2019
```

## Running the code

Open up this repo in your favourite editor. Run `npm install` once to get dependencies then `npm test` to start the test watcher.
